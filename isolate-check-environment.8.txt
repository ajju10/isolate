ISOLATE-CHECK-ENVIRONMENT(8)
============================

NAME
----
isolate-check-environment - Check for common environment quirks

SYNOPSIS
--------
*isolate-check-environment* [*-q*|*--quiet*] [*e*|*--execute*]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This script can be used to identify sources of run-time variability and other issues on
Linux machines which may affect *isolate*(1).

If *--execute* is not specified, the recommended actions are written to stdout as an executable
shell script. With *--execute*, the script will attempt to make changes to make the system
behave more deterministically.

The changes performed by *--execute* persist only
until a reboot. To persist across reboots, the standard output from this script
should be added to `/etc/rc.local` or some other script that is run on each boot.
Alternately, you could execute *isolate-check-environment --quiet --execute*
from `rc.local`, but use this with caution as not all issues can be resolved in this way.

The exit status will be 0 if all checks pass, or 1 if some checks have failed.

Note that there are more strategies to reduce run-time variability further.
See *isolate*(1) for details under REPRODUCIBILITY.
